Generate a multi-slide Instagram carousel content with the following structure:
- Main page: title, highlighted words, description (same as title), page number, brand handle (@key4success__), swipe instruction ("Swipe Left ðŸ‘‰")
- SubPages: 
  - Numbered bullet points (2 or 3, max 30 words each) starting from 1 and continuing across pages.
  - Each subpage has the same description as the main page.
  - Page number, brand handle (@key4success__), swipe instruction ("Swipe Left ðŸ‘‰") for each subpage.
- Thank you page and promotion page: both with no content for now.
